# Keywords

## This will be a list of keywords pertaining to the current topic. 
## We will see a lot of these repeated as we go along.

* Class
* Function - "Beginner" definition - set of instructions that takes an input and releases an output (See: temperature convert function)
* Separation of Concerns/Modularity - The idea that if one piece of your code does something different from another piece of your code, they most likely should be different functions
* Parsing - A parser goes through your code to able to determine the meaning of pieces of your code. 
* Syntax - string or set of characters that are well defined. Ex: Girl dog candy.
* Semantics - Valid syntax that actually has meaning. Ex: I are awesome. 
* Compile Time Errors - When a compiler tries to make sense of your program and can't 
* Compile Time Error: Lexical Errors - In lexical analysis, the lexor, breaks up the program into a stream of tokens
* Compile Time Error: Tokens - programming language specific keywords, operators, identifiers, numbers, punctuation
* Compile Time Error: Syntax Error: When the parse tree can not be constructed 
* Compile Time Error: Parser - A parser organizers the tokens into a specific hierarchy called a parse tree
* Compile Time Error: Static Semantic Errors - Semantic analysis tries to discover the meaning of a program by analyzing the parse tree
* Compile Time Error: Static Semantic Checking Examples: Type checking, every variable is declared before use, multiple declarations (dependent on scope), checking function call arguments, identifiers used appropriately  
* Identifiers - Names in the program Ex: We named the function for temperature convert "FtoC"
* Runtime Errors - In the middle of execution, the program runs into a problem and can't finish execution or provides the wrong output.
* Runtime Error: Dynamic semantic error. Ex: Destroy the world by dividing by 0, a variable is used but not initialized, array out of bounds error 
* Exception - Brought up during runtime when runtime fails 
* Invoke - To call
* Type - "Beginner" definition - a set of values and operations that operate on those set of values
* Parameter - A type that gets passed into a function that the function uses to execute its set of instructions. (See: temperature convert function) If a function requires an integer to be passed to it, the integer *type* is the parameter
* Argument - The actual value of the type that gets passed into a function. 
* Algorithm - A recipe to solve a problem
* Scope - "Beginner" definition - Where you are in the program 
* Expression - produces a result, an expression is usually evaluated
* Statement - statement does not produce a result, it is relied to DO something, a statement is usually executed
* Variables - space in memory where a value is stored
* Assignment Statements - basic assignment of variables, format: <variable> = <expression> (x = y doesn't necessarily mean y = x)
* Operand - specified quantity or element manipulated
* Casting
* Coercion


## Programming Process as by John Zelle
* Analyze problem 
* Determine specifications: What the program will do and what will it accomplish
* Create a design: create the structure of the program
* Implement the design: transolate the design into specified programming language
* Test and Debug: Over and over and over again
* Maintain the program: Be able to apply patches 

## Programming Process: What I think
* Clarify what the program is supposed to do
* Visualize the program running 
* Use design tools to create a model. Ex: Wireframes, UML diagram (flow of your program), drawings. pseudocode 
* Check the model for errors 
* Start writing code and then try to compile: You decide when you feel like you should compile again (Don't try to write the entire program in one sitting)
* Correct errors during programming process
* Repeat previous 2 steps as needed
* When you get to a point where you're done or almost done, test, test, test, test, test, test
* Repeat as often as possible (previous 4 steps)
* Validate (Maintain the program)
