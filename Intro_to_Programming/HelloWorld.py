# Hello World Program

# Function: main() - Print out Hello World
# If I don't put main() at the end, it will compile I guess but not give me an output


def main():
    print("Hello, World!")
    
main()

# So, the main() is the invokation which is needed to call our function
# Can be done with a different function name
# Example: We can do

#def hello():
#    print("Hello, World!")
#hello()


# This will function the same way as the main() one
