# An addition program in Python
# addition function - Take 2 inputs, add them up and store them into a variable, here we call z
# Print z

def addition(x, y):
    result = x + y
    print(result)

addition(str(3.0), " hello")

# When we invoke the addition function in the last line, we set x = 3.0, y = 2.0

# "3.0" + " hello" = "3.0 hello"
