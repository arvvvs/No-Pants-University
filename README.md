# Welcome to No Pants University!

**Stream Link**: [No Pants University](https://www.livecoding.tv/benevolently/)

Here we will learn things. 

But seriously, the idea here is to try to go through some of a college curriculum all while learning from home. 
Hence the name, "No Pants University." You are not to be confined by the need to wear pants in a classroom setting.

But even more seriously, I feel like I've become rusty even though I recently graduated. 
I feel like I need to re-learn earlier topics and try to get more out of them.

So, join me on my journey to learn/re-learn/get more out of my learning!

## Tenative List of Topics

* Introduction to Computer Programming
* Object Oriented Programming
* Computer Systems/Computer Architecture
* Data Structures and Algorithms
* Algorithm Design and Analysis
* Automata Theory (Maybe)
* Design Patterns
* Advanced Object Oriented Programming Concepts (From a class that I took while matriculated at Binghamton U)
* Functional Programming

*Open to suggestions.*

## Bonus Topics

* Databases
* Web Development
* Data Mining (Maybe)
* Some Mathematical Concepts (Not sure how I will show them on stream yet)

*Open to suggestions.*

## Structure

* Code repository where all the code will be: [No Pants University Repo](https://github.com/Ben-Evolently/No-Pants-University/)
* There will be folders noting the topics I have done or will be doing. 
* Each folder will have a README.md that notes the different subtopics within the parent topic.
* There will be a Questions.md that notes noteable questions asked on stream or I ask myself.
* If I don't know an answer to a question, I'll research it and comeback on the next stream to answer it and it will be noted in the file.
* There might be a ([Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/)) where I will put written notes on.
* There might be slides or something along that sort. 
* Recorded videos might be put on Vimeo/YouTube

*Open to suggestions.*

## Watch as a noob (myself) stumbles through computer science!
