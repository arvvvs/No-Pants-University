# Welcome to my Stream!

Here we will learn things.

But seriously, I spent a lot of time twiddling my thumbs in the early part of my college career. 

It was not until recently that I realized I had been slacking and could have been so much better. 

So, now, I want to re-learn things as well as give beginners a means to learn as well. 
So, that's why I called this stream, "No Pants University." 
You can learn from home while not having to wear pants like in a classroom setting. 

So, I don't have a full structure of the "curriculum" yet but I will by end the of the weekend hopefully.
This might go by relatively fast but if there are questions, please ask on stream or send them to my e-mail: bienvenidocrodriguez@gmail.com.
If I can't answer the questions in an instant, then I will note it and address it properly on the following stream.
I will also note a list of noteable questions in a file so if new watchers come on or people just review old videos, they can refer to that file as well.

# Topics (That I will Hopefully Put In Order)

Here will be all the generalized topics that we will learn. 
When I'm in a specific topic, I will note in another file all the subtopics we will be going through so this file doesn't get out of control.

* Intro to Programming (Most likely in Python)
* More to come...


# Structure of Stream

I haven't fully decided how I will structure this aside from streaming the information. 
I was thinking of making a Gitbook with all the accompanying topics. I was also thinking of adding slides of some sort.
I also will probably add diagrams to describe certain vague concepts.
I'm open to suggestions. 
In addition to the recordings on the Livecoding, I will also post these to YouTube or Vimeo, if everyone thinks that's a good idea.

# This is All For Free

I'm all about learning and being a forever learner. 
So, I will gladly purchase new and noteworthy books and take the information I learn from them and make plans of my own to demonstrate to watchers.
But if you love my work, donations are greatly appreciated. But by no means is it necessary. I love doing teaching. 
Everytime I was a TA in undergrad, I was happy to help people with their concerns and questions. 
I was also happy to research questions I didn't know the answer to off the top of my head and return to them a proper answer.
