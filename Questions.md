## Questions: Cause It's Part of Learning

This is where I will note questions I see on stream or questions I ask myself.

Everytime I am back on stream, I will go over some questions that I formulated off stream.

I will also go over some questions from the previous stream, especially the ones I didn't know the answers to.

I will try to address the questions during the current stream they are asked in but I think it's better, especially if the question requres some thought and a lengthy explanation or demonstration, to leave it for the beginning of the next stream. 

* What can actually be computed? What are our limitations?
* How does the hardware factor into all of this?
* How does memory fit into the scheme of things? How are things stored?
* Parameters vs. Arguments?
* Script vs. Program?
* What types of errors will we encounter?
